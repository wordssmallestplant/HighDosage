My final project for web design, a coffee based html document set!!

The ZIP file contains the following:
> 2 css folders, one for general styling and one for styling the latte game.
> 2 js folders, one for general functionality and one for the latte game (again, lol).
> 6 html files, (index, farming, history, flavors, coffeematch, createalatte).
> 3 image folders for added organization (!these are in a css subfolder!).
> audio folder containing audio for the latte game

~4/6 pages have javascript functionality, the only ones without are farming + history as they're mainly infographic.~
The entire project has been throughly tested and debugged - no errors show in console.log() upon booting.
